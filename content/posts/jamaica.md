One of my favourite things in Mexico is agua de jamaica. It's refreshing, healthy and tastes like fruit punch. I usually order it without sugar, but this one place - Ramiro's Cocina in Merida - makes it with strawberry juice and serves it with a salted rim. Delicious and refreshing on a hot Yucatan afternoon.

Yum.
