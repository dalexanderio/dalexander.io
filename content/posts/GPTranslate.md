## Using ChatGPT for more effective translations.

I'm currently working remotely in Mexico and as a Canadian I've never really been exposed to Spanish in my home country. This has made it especially hard to learn as I was starting from absolute zero. Duolingo was of some use for grammar (not so much for manzanas) but for day-to-day phrases I've relied on good ol' Google translate. This is OK for most situations, but I've learned that what might be a correct translation isn’t always how people speak.

For example, I've been asking if I can pay by cash or card by saying "tarjeta o dinero?" because this is what google translate shows:

![dinero](https://files.catbox.moe/l3fgyd.png)

I would get some confused stares but people seemed to know what I was asking. Eventually, I was told "efectivo" was a much better translation as "dinero" refers to "money" more than physical cash. 

Since I now run the rest of my problems in life through ChatGPT I decided to try this one too - and was surprised I got the correct result!

Here are a few more examples:

I can't say how accurate these are, but I feel like I’m being understood better since I started relying less on Google Translate. Id love to hear the opinions of some native speakers.
