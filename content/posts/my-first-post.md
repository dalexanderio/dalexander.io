Hugo along with jekyll have been the go-to frameworks for static website hosting for a while now. I find github pages to be the most common way to host a hugo site but Amplify only takes a few clicks to configure everything - especially if you're using Route53 for DNS. Personally, I love AWS but dislike Amazon as a company. Luckily Amplify is free tier elegible so you can host away, guilt free! 

Eventually I plan on adding a markdown feature that turns image locations into s3 links that embed in blogposts, but for now I'm pretty happy with this configuration.
